# Sorting-Visualizer
JavaScript application for sorting algorithms 
This is a personal project that implements popular sorting algorithims visually. 
How each algorithm sorts the bars can be seen by the use of colours.

LEGEND:


Yellow - The algorithm is comparing two bars

Red - The algorithm has found two bars that are out of place and need to be swapped 

Green - The bar is in it's final position


Quick sort colours:

Dark Blue - Current pivot bar

Orange - Checking the first smaller bar compared to the pivot starting from the right side

Pink - Indicates the first smaller bar compared to the pivot starting from the right side

Purple - Checking the first larger bar compared to the pivot starting from the left side

Turquoise - Indicates the first larger bar compared to the pivot starting from the left side
